                            He lives nowhere being a perpetual traveler. He has being most of his professional (and personal) life a mega software programmer and very complex-problem solver. As a rebel, he is passionate about the financial freedom Bitcoin means for humans in this complicated nowadays world, and he has one dream: Bitcoin mass adoption.
                            His first Bitcoin purchase was in 2013 and since then all his savings have been exchanged to Bitcoin. He has helped dozens of humans to make their bitcoin purchases, open their wallets, change their providers… while he was seeing humans struggling to understand, he got an idea…. created the solution in his mind...then started coding…. and he finished the first version of Bapp.
                            He is the user of every single service Bapp offered and the many more to come that are already in his non-human mind.
